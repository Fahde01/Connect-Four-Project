This C++ program implements a complete Connect Four game for two players (Red and Yellow) using a text-based console interface with a modular, function-based architecture that separates concerns across eight distinct functions. The game creates a 6x7 grid using a two-dimensional vector data structure initialized with dash characters representing empty spaces, and displays it with proper formatting including column numbers (1-7) below for player reference. Players take turns dropping pieces ('R' or 'Y') into columns, with the playPiece function simulating gravity by searching from the bottom row upward to find the first empty position, converting between one-based user input and zero-based array indexing. The program includes comprehensive input validation through the isValidPlay function that ensures column selections are within the 1-7 range and verifies the top row of the chosen column isn't occupied, while also handling non-numeric input gracefully by checking if the input stream operation succeeds before processing the value. After each move, the checkWin function executes a sophisticated four-part algorithm that examines the newly placed piece's position: it scans the entire row counting consecutive matching pieces for horizontal wins, scans the entire column for vertical wins, checks ascending diagonals by iterating through rows 3-5 and columns 0-3 to verify four consecutive positions moving from bottom-left to top-right, and checks descending diagonals by iterating through rows 0-2 and columns 0-3 to verify positions moving from top-left to bottom-right. The main game loop in the playGame function orchestrates the entire experience by managing a currentPlayer index that toggles between 0 and 1 using the formula "1 - currentPlayer," maintaining a needToDisplayBoard flag to prevent redundant renders after invalid input, allowing players to quit by entering -1, and checking both win conditions through the checkWin function and tie conditions through the isBoardFull function that scans every cell for remaining empty spaces. Throughout the implementation, the program demonstrates strong programming practices including efficient pass-by-reference parameters with const qualifiers for read-only operations to avoid unnecessary data copying, modern C++ range-based for loops for cleaner iteration, single-responsibility functions that each handle one specific task, robust error handling that provides immediate user feedback without crashing, and careful state management that tracks board configuration, current player turn, and game progression, ultimately creating a fully playable Connect Four experience that displays the final board state and announces the winner by name when four pieces align in any direction or declares "Tie game" when the board fills completely without achieving a winning configuration.RetryClaude can make mistakes.
